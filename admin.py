# This file might contain logic to manage or interact with the traffic environment
# You might import and use your TrafficEnv class here

# Example:
# from traffic import TrafficEnv
#
# def run_simulation():
#     env = TrafficEnv(...)
#     obs, info = env.reset()
#     done = False
#     while not done:
#         action = env.action_space.sample() # Or your agent's action
#         obs, reward, done, truncated, info = env.step(action)
#         env.render()
#     env.close()
#
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     run_simulation()

# Add your actual admin logic here
